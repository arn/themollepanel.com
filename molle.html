    <h3>What is MOLLE?</h3>
    
    <p>
      MOLLE is an acronym for <strong>MO</strong>dular <strong>L</strong>ightweight <strong>L</strong>oad-carrying <strong>E</strong>quipment.
      It is said as the female name "Molly."
      The MOLLE acronym initially applied specifically to load-bearing pouches and equipment designed to take advantage of the
      <strong>P</strong>ouch <strong>A</strong>ttachment <strong>L</strong>adder <strong>S</strong>ystem (PALS).
      Over time, MOLLE has come to be used as the generic term for both the attachment ladder webbing and the pouches and attachment that take advantage of that webbing.

      PALS was developed and adopted in the late 1990s by the United States Army.
      Since its introduction, PALS has been adopted by the other branches of service as well as foreign militaries including that of the United Kingdom.
      The PALS / MOLLE system replaces the ALICE system, which has been in active service since 1973.
